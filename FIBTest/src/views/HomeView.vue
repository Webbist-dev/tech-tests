    <h1>Alex Bennett | Technical test</h1>
    <p>Hey folks, here is my anwser to the brief provided. It's a simple vue application using Vue3 and Vite.</p>
    <p>Using axios for requests to your test api it renders a list of users with simple pagination and routing, guests can be queried via a date range and can also be navigated to for specific details on orders.</p>
    <p>To build this project, check the readme, it's a no brainer, project was spun up using the cli.</p>

    <small>Some things I would do if this were a production application</small>

    <ul>
      <li>Add meta.total &amp; meta.count to response from Api (I've spent too much time with GraphQl!)</li>
      <li>Add comments &amp; documentation</li>
      <li>Make pagination a global component</li>
      <li>Abstract functions and make agnostic</li>
      <li>Abstract api calls</li>
      <li>Additional design and UX work (make it prettier)</li>
      <li>Sort by on columns</li>
      <li>Placeholder loading of data</li>
      <li>Loading spinner on requests</li>
      <li>Proper error handling</li>
      <li>Search functionality</li>
      <li>Filter functionality</li>
      <li>Add user functionality</li>
      <li>PWA functionality</li>
      <li>Page or element transitions</li>
      <li>If scaling up include Nuxt</li>
      <li>Hosting, CI/CD</li>
      <li>Performance review for application speed</li>
    </ul>
